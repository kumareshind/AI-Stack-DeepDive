# AI Stack DeepDive

Welcome to **AI Stack DeepDive**! This repository is the foundation for a multi-part series where we‚Äôll explore the complete AI stack‚Äîfrom the hardware fundamentals to high-level applications and future trends. This series is designed to be an in-depth technical journey, blending architectural views, practical learning notes, and unique insights into the evolving landscape of AI.

### üöÄ About the Series

The field of AI is built on a complex stack of technologies, each layer critical to the next. In this series, we‚Äôll peel back each layer to understand what makes it tick, focusing on the following levels:

1. **Hardware Layer**: The foundational bedrock of AI, covering GPUs, TPUs, and specialized accelerators. We‚Äôll dive into the architectures, such as NVIDIA‚Äôs Tensor Cores and AMD‚Äôs Matrix Cores, and discuss the physical limits and innovative solutions shaping AI hardware today.
  
2. **Infrastructure Layer**: Here, we explore how data centers, distributed systems, and cloud providers support AI workloads at scale. We‚Äôll cover storage, networking, and compute management, which makes training large models possible.

3. **Data and ML Frameworks**: The tools that translate raw data into training-ready formats and the frameworks that enable model building. We‚Äôll look into popular ML libraries, data pipelines, and preprocessing techniques, providing hands-on insights.

4. **Model Development and Training**: This is where the magic happens‚Äîdesigning, training, and optimizing AI models. From neural network architectures to hyperparameter tuning, we‚Äôll break down the core steps of model development.

5. **Deployment and Serving**: Once a model is trained, the challenge shifts to deployment. We‚Äôll cover containerization, model serving platforms, and the considerations for bringing AI into production environments.

6. **Applications and Future Trends**: AI is transforming industries, but the future holds even more. We‚Äôll discuss emerging applications, ethical considerations, and potential advancements in AI technology, including my perspectives on what‚Äôs next.
